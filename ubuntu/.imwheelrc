# After you create this file in ~ directory, you start it with imwheel -b "4 5"
# before starting it you might have to stop a process if it was already running
# with: killall imwheel
# The reason you pass the -b flag is you only want to target specific buttons
# Otherwise it blocks your mouses side buttons (back, forth, etc)

# The command used to see the name for the application you want to set the
# speed for is:
# xprop WM_CLASS | grep -o '"[^"]*"' | head -n 1
# after you run the command you just click on the application window and the
# name shows in terminal

# Speed up Chrome scrolling
# Button4 is scrolling up, Button5 is scrolling down
# to change the speed, edit the number after the comma on the lines starting
# with None
