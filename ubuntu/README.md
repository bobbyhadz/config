### Desktop

Workspaces refer to grouping of windows on your desktop.

- You can create multiple workspaces, which act like virtual desktops.
- Workspaces are meant to reduce clutter and make the desktop easier to
  navigate.
- For example you could have all your communication windows, such as e-mail and
  your chat program, on one workspace, your code editor/programming stuff on
  another workspace and your music player could be on a third workspace.
- In order to use workspaces click on Activities in the top bar, a vertical
  panel will appear showing workspaces in use, plus an empty workspace. This is
  the workspace selector. To add a workspace, drag and drop a window from an
  existing workspace onto the empty workspace in the workspace selector. The
  workspace now contains the window you have dropped, and a new empty workspace
  will appear below it. To remove a workspace, simply close all of its windows
  or move them to other workspaces.
